Make a program that reads three floating point values: A, B and C. Then, calculate and show:
* The area of the rectangled triangle that has base A and height C.
* The area of the radius's circle C. (pi = 3.14159)
* The area of the trapezium which has A and B by base, and C by height.
* The area of ​​the square that has side B.
* The area of the rectangle that has sides A and B.

## Input <br>
The input file contains three double values with one digit after the decimal point.

## Output <br>
The output file must contain 5 lines of data. Each line corresponds to one of the areas described above, always with a corresponding message (in Portuguese) and one space between the two points and the value. The value calculated must be presented with 3 digits after the decimal point.
